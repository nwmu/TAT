This folder consist five files
	1.Report 
	2.PowerPoint presentation 
	3.Project.py
	4.Dataset
	5.Readme 
	6.Screenshots of the application
	7.report.csv

How to open Application:
	As this is a GUI application for better user experience we have kept it as a single python file instead of notebook – project.py is python file 
	We can you TAT just by running the single python file – project.py

Requirements :
	1.Python version 2.7 or more
	2.Install required python libraries like numpy , pandas , sklearn , matplotlib , pylab , tkinter , xlsxwriter ,etc


Steps :
	1.Use any kind of python IDE or default python IDE to open the project.py file 
	2.Make sure all the libraries required in the program were installed in machine
	3.If any one of the package / library is missing use command “pip install <package_name>” to install that particular library 
	4.Run the module project.py to start the interface 
	5.If you want to start application through command line use command “python <path>/project.py”  
	6.You can see interface similar to the screenshots presented in screenshots folder
	7.Use the “upload” button to upload the given demo dataset to the TAT (you can test the application with any kind of classification datasets) 
	8.Use the “read data” set button to see the first and last five rows of the data uploaded
	9.Use the “test train split” button to split the data to 80 : 20 train and test data sets
	10.Then click on “all classifiers” button to fit your data into 11 different classification algorithms and test against the test dataset, you can see the summary of fit , confusion matrix and other metrics against fits
	11.To get the accuracy comparison on every model click “model comparison” button 
	12.A excel format report file can be generated by the “generate report” button which has all the metrics towards the each and every model 
	13.Use the excel operations to select the best performing algorithm on the data uploaded as per the requirement
